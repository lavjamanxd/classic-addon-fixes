TauntMaster is a threat-management addon.  It automatically displays a button for every member of your party or raid.
If the party/raid member begins to gain more threat than the tank, their button turns yellow.
If they begin to insecurely tank, it turns orange.
If they are securely tanking, it turns red.
If another party member gains aggro, simply click their button and TauntMaster will automatically taunt their target off of them.
Taunt Master is pre-programmed to cast the following taunts on whichever party or raid member you click:

All Classes:
	Ctrl-Alt Click:  Assist

	Left Click:  Dark Command
	Right Click:  Death Grip

Open up the spell bindings menu to set your own spells to whichever mouse buttons you want.
Click which mouse button you'd like to program and enter the exact name of the spell in the edit box.
Then you MUST select a target
	-if you want to cast the spell on a friend (like Righteous Defense or Intervene) then click friend ([@mouseover])
	-if you want to cast the spell on an enemy (like taunt, death grip, etc.) click enemy ([@mouseovertarget])

A blue border indicates the player is a tank.
A green border indicates the player has a friendly target.
If a player's mana drops below 10% "MANA!" will be displayed over their frame.
